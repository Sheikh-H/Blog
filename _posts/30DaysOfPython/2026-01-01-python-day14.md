title: Higher Order Functions - Learning How To Use Functions Within Functions
description: >-
  Higher Order Functions is the term used to describe the ability to have function return functions, use a function as an input, or modifying a function. In Day 10 of the 30 days of Python by Asabeneh, I'll now be going back over how to use HOF and Decorators.

<abbr title = "Higher Order Functions">HOF</abbr> is what developers use to be able to create complex functions. Functions that are used as either input or an output of another function. We also use **Decorators** to modify existing functions we have built earlier on in our code to be able to add new functionality to it.

Both these method's have their own syntax in how they should be used, it would be easier to understand HOF first and then go on to learning Decorators. At this point, I'm not really able to elaborate much on both these concepts as I've not had a lot of experience with them. Designing small systems and applications prevent you from really learning the depths of coding you would want.

So for me, this topic will be more useful later on.

## Getting a Function as an Input

Let's try use our first HOF.

```python

# Our initial function:

# Returns the sum of the numbers provided as argument
def sum_numbers(num):
  return sum(num) # This does the calculation to return the sum

# Our HOF:
def hof(func, lst):
  # Given it 2 parameters, one for a function, the other a normal input
  sum = func(lst) # Used the same syntax as using a normal function, this just helps the code know that it's a function.
  return sum # This uses the function on the list

result = hof(sum_numbers, [1,2,3,4,5])
print(result) # 15
```

_Taken from course_

I want to be able to explain the above code so that I can get myself a little more clearer on the idea of HOF functions. In this example, we've created an initial function that, so to speak, does the actual work. We've then created a sub function that acts as the HOF and uses the initial function we designed as a parameter followed by a parameter used as the input.

If we pay attention to the initial function, we can see that we wouldn't necessarily need the HOF as this one alone would be able to perform the calculation and return the result.

What I would like to highlight is how we've created a parameter for the HOF we have to take a function as an input. Very similar to just creating a normal parameter except here we treat this parameter as a function throughout the code inside the HOF. This is where we begin to see how we are able to use a function as an input.

To me, as it stands now, it looks like the reason why we learn a lot about syntax is because this is what is used to identify different 'data types' throughout our code. Any variable could be either a function, string, integer, boolean etc and so it's not just to do with how it present data inside the function but also how we use that variable that help Python understand what we do with the variable.

Think of it as like renaming the initial function inside the HOF.

This is another example we can use to help us understand a little more.

```python
def square(x):          # a square function
    return x ** 2

def cube(x):            # a cube function
    return x ** 3

def absolute(x):        # an absolute value function
    if x >= 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -(x)

def higher_order_function(func): # a higher order function returning a function
    if func == 'square':
        return square
    elif func == 'cube':
        return cube
    elif func == 'absolute':
        return absolute

result = higher_order_function('square')
print(result(3))       # 9
result = higher_order_function('cube')
print(result(3))       # 27
result = higher_order_function('absolute')
print(result(-3))      # 3
```

_Taken from the course_

This should shed some light on how functions are able to almost interlink. The idea you want to takeaway from here is that you can have many functions that all work within one function. The design principle behind this is to have initial functions that _do the task_ and then a HOF that houses them all together _for output_.

## Python Closures

Another concept we need to briefly explain is using a HOF as a variable instead, this is regarded as Python Closures.

```python
def outer(x): # Outer function
    def inner(y): # Inner function
        return x + y # Inner calculation result
    return inner # Outer result

add_five = outer(5)

print(add_five(3)) # 8
```
